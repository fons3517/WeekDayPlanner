// I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

// When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

// When I scroll, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

// When I view timeblocks for that day, each block is color coded to indicate whether it's in past, present, or future

// When I click into a timeblock, then I can enter an event

// When I click Save button for timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage

// When I refresh page, then saved events persist
